Project 1 done as Project Intern at Garuda Aerospace

This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting early and late blight in potato crops, leveraging advances in deep learning and computer vision. Using TensorFlow and Keras, we will create a robust model capable of accurately identifying these diseases from images. OpenCV will be integrated for efficient image processing and feature extraction, enhancing the model's performance. The final system will provide farmers and agricultural professionals with a scalable, automated tool to monitor and manage crop health, ensuring timely interventions and reducing crop losses.
